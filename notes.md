# General notes
- The repo structure is not very clear, so I am focusing just of the **Hands-on** folder
- Makefile must have the correct capitalization in Linux and does not work

# Code
## Major
- I have no idea of how the code can compile in this condition
- There are errors in the division of header and source files
- There are errors in dividing definition and declaration
- There are errors in what should be private and what public
- Number of OMP threads shoould not be hard-coded
- Things that could be passed by reference are passed by copy
